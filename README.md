Data Analytics Project
Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from data ingestion and exploratory analysis to querying with SQL and delivering insights through dashboards and presentations. The goal is to showcase practical skills in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and business reporting.

Dataset

The dataset is loaded and analyzed using Python.

It contains structured data suitable for exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning, and SQL-based querying.

Data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats are addressed during preprocessing.

Tools & Technologies

Python: Data loading, EDA, and data cleaning

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib / seaborn

PostgreSQL: Data storage and SQL querying

SQL: Analytical queries and aggregations

Power BI: Interactive dashboard and visual analytics

Gamma: Presentation (PPT) creation

Markdown: Project documentation

Project Steps

Data Loading

Imported raw data into Python for initial inspection.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships.

Identified data quality issues and potential insights.

Data Cleaning

Handled missing values and duplicates.

Standardized column names, formats, and data types.

Prepared cleaned data for database storage and analysis.

Database & SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into a PostgreSQL server.

Wrote SQL queries to answer key analytical questions.

Performed aggregations and filtering for reporting.

Dashboard Development

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Visualized key metrics, trends, and insights.

Reporting & Presentation

Created a written analytical report summarizing findings.

Developed a presentation (PPT) using Gamma to communicate results clearly to stakeholders.

Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Trend analysis and comparisons

Interactive filters for deeper exploration

Results & Insights

Identified meaningful patterns and trends in the data.

Translated raw data into actionable insights.

Demonstrated the ability to communicate findings through both visuals and structured reporting.
