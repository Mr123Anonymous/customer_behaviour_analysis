# Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from data ingestion and exploratory analysis to querying with SQL and delivering insights through dashboards and presentations. The goal is to showcase practical skills in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and business reporting.

## Dataset

* The dataset is loaded and analyzed using Python.
* It contains structured data suitable for exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning, and SQL-based querying.
* Data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats are addressed during preprocessing.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python**: Data loading, EDA, and data cleaning

  * Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib / seaborn
* **PostgreSQL**: Data storage and SQL querying
* **SQL**: Analytical queries and aggregations
* **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard and visual analytics
* **Gamma**: Presentation (PPT) creation
* **Markdown**: Project documentation

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading**

   * Imported raw data into Python for initial inspection.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships.
   * Identified data quality issues and potential insights.

3. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handled missing values and duplicates.
   * Standardized column names, formats, and data types.
   * Prepared cleaned data for database storage and analysis.

4. **Database & SQL Analysis**

   * Loaded cleaned data into a PostgreSQL server.
   * Wrote SQL queries to answer key analytical questions.
   * Performed aggregations and filtering for reporting.

5. **Dashboard Development**

   * Built an interactive Power BI dashboard.
   * Visualized key metrics, trends, and insights.

6. **Reporting & Presentation**

   * Created a written analytical report summarizing findings.
   * Developed a presentation (PPT) using Gamma to communicate results clearly to stakeholders.

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

* Key performance indicators (KPIs)
* Trend analysis and comparisons
* Interactive filters for deeper exploration

## Results & Insights

* Identified meaningful patterns and trends in the data.
* Translated raw data into actionable insights.
* Demonstrated the ability to communicate findings through both visuals and structured reporting.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Python scripts/notebooks for EDA and data cleaning.
4. Load the cleaned data into PostgreSQL.
5. Execute the provided SQL queries.
6. Open the Power BI file to explore the dashboard.
7. Review the report and presentation for summarized insights.
